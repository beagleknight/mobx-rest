# Changelog

## `7.1.0``

  - Added `Collection#last` method

## `7.0.1``

  - One more performance improvement by optimizing `Collection#constructor` to just reset the collection

## `7.0.0``

  - Breaking: Moved indexes as getters so they are available during the first `Collection#set` call in the constructor
  - Refactored `Collection#set` to batch all the additions so indexes are not recalculated for each addition.
  - Refactored `Model#constructor` to directly set the attributes instead of initialize with an empty map and replace it.

## `6.0.1``

  - Fix peformance regression for `set` introduced in 4.0.0 with the addition of indexes: We were creating a model just to call the `primaryKey` method instead of just calling the prototype.

## `6.0.0``
  - Remove mustFind and mustGet methods

## `5.0.7`

  - Improved error messages when an invariant fails.

## `5.0.6`

  - Defend some cases when data is not present.


## `5.0.5`

  - Avoids `add` adding duplicated records and switches `model.save` to use add instead of `set`

## `5.0.3`

  - Fixes another edge case when passing a model to `collection.set`

## `5.0.2`

  - Fixes edge case when a request fails and no collection was given

## `5.0.1`

  - Fixes edge case where a model without `id` would make `collection.set` fail.

## `5.0.0`

  - Made `set` accept models too, not only attributes.
  - Now, `save` will add the model to the collection if one is assigned. This allows people to use `collection.build + save` effectively.

## `4.0.2`

  - Fixes `filter` throwing errors when targeting non-existing attributes.

## `4.0.1`

  - Allow a default primary key if model didn't return a class

## `4.0.0`

  - Added indexes to optimize filter and find

## `3.0.5`

  - Rollback default `patch` flag value to `true`.

## `3.0.0`
